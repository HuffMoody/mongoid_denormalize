Mongoid::Denormalize
====================

Helper module for denormalizing association attributes in Mongoid models. Why denormalize? Read *[A Note on Denormalization](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/MongoDB+Data+Modeling+and+Rails#MongoDBDataModelingandRails-ANoteonDenormalization)*.

Extracted from [coookin'](http://coookin.com), where it is used in production.


Installation
------------

Add the gem to your Bundler `Gemfile`:

    gem 'mongoid_denormalize'

Or install with RubyGems:

    $ gem install mongoid_denormalize


Usage
-----

In your model:

    # Include the helper method
    include Mongoid::Denormalize
    
    # Define your denormalized fields
    denormalize :name, :email, :from => :user



Example
-------

    class User
      include Mongoid::Document
      include Mongoid::Denormalize

      references_many :comments

      field :name
      field :email
      
      denormalize :name, :email, :to => :comments
    end
    
    class Comment
      include Mongoid::Document
      include Mongoid::Denormalize

      referenced_in :user

      field :body
      
      denormalize :name, :email, :from => :user
    end
    
    >> user = User.create(:name => "John Doe", :email => "john@doe.com")
    >> comment = Comment.create(:body => "Lorem ipsum...", :user => user)
    >> user.comments << comment
    >> comment.user_name
    "John Doe"
    >> comment.user_email
    "john@doe.com"
    >> user.update_attributes(:name => "Bill")
    >> comment.user_name
    "Bill"


Options
-------

Denormalization can happen in either or both directions. When using the `:from` option, the associated objects will fetch the values from
the parent. When using the `:to` option, the parent will push the values to its children.

    # Basic denormalization. Will set the user_name attribute with the associated user's name.
    denormalize :name, :from => :user
    
    # Basic denormalization. Will set the user_name attribute of "self.comments" with "self.name".
    denormalize :name, :to => :comments
    
    # Multiple fields. Will set the user_name and user_email attributes with the associated user's name and email.
    denormalize :name, :email, :from => :user
    
    # Multiple children. Will set the user_name attribute of "self.posts" and "self.comments" with "self.name".
    denormalize :name, :to => [:posts, :comments]


Rake tasks
----------

A rake task is included for verifying and repairing inconsistent denormalizations. This might be useful your records may be modified
without Mongoid, or if you are using relational associations in combination with embedded records (see *Known issues*).

    rake db:denormalize
    
This task will only update records that have outdated denormalized fields.


Known issues
------------

**Relational associations in combination with embedded records**

If you are using denormalize with the `:to` option, to denormalize values on a relational association that is embedded in another collection,
the denormalized fields will not be updated when the parent record is changed. This is due to a limitation in Mongoid that prevents querying
embedded records through relational associations. One way to overcome this issue is to run `rake db:denormalize` in a cron job.
